Demonstration of the solutions of Exercise 8 for the [Modelling and Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems in Julia class](https://github.com/TUM-PIK-ESM/TUM-Dynamics-Lecture) at TU Munich. 

This repository features zero dimensional energy balance models (EBMs) as presented in the lecture. The package implements those models and [the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/Exercise8.jl/blob/main/exercise8-solutions.ipynb) explores their dynamics and presents the solutions.
